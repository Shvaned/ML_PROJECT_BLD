Take into consideration, 

only use feed.py for classification, but if you want to train the model yourself

have a set of .npy files ready, features of each videos

The features from each video (33 landmarks with 4 features each), needs to be statistically summarized to perform clustering using unsup.py
Then run super.py to train model using random forest.

due to upload limit, i cannot upload .npy files and label set
only the ready model, scaler and a sample video

have a labelled set
